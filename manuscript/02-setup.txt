# Setup

For this workshop we're using a vagrant image - it is a Windows Server 2016 image with docker pre-installed.
It is **strongly** advised that you set up this environment and test that it works prior to the workshop if _at all_ possible.
Once the lab environment is set up you should _not_ need to download anything else.

## Prerequisites:

You must have Vagrant and a hypervisor (Hyper-V or VirtualBox) installed.

* [instructions for installing Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/getting-started/install.html)
* [Instructions for installing Hyper-V](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v)
  * [Instructions for adding an external switch](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/virtualization/hyper-v/get-started/create-a-virtual-switch-for-hyper-v-virtual-machines).
    This is necessary so that your machine can connect to the internet to download some prerequisites.
* [Instructions for installing VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

## Steps

1. Download the `Vagrantfile` from [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaeltlombardi/pwshop/master/Vagrantfile) into a folder on your machine.
   * If it appended the `.txt` extension to the file, remove it.
     The file should just be `Vagrantfile`, no extension.
   * You may find it easiest to copy and paste the contents into a text file named `Vagrantfile` (no extension) in a folder on your machine.
2. Open a terminal [with administrator privileges](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-open-an-elevated-powershell-prompt-in-windows-10), navigate to the folder where you saved the `VagrantFile`, and run the command below:
   * `vagrant up --provision`
3. This will download and spin up the lab machine for this workshop and get you ready to learn some PowerShell!

## Controlling the Environment

You can _pause and resume_ the environment:

* `vagrant suspend`
* `vagrant resume`

You can _halt_ the environment, freeing up RAM:

* `vagrant halt`

You can _destroy_ the environment, freeing up disk space:

* `vagrant destroy`

You can bring the environment back up after _halting_ or _destroying_ it using the same command as when you first brought it up:

* `vagrant up --provision`
