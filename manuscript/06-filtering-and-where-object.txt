# Filtering & Where-Object

One particularly good use case for the pipeline is to filter objects for further use.
It is _best_ practice, where possible, to "filter left" - that is, to filter objects when you're querying for them rather than retrieving an unfiltered list and selecting the desired values afterward.

For example, your Active Directory / LDAP / SQL administrators probably _do not_ want you continually running queries to retrieve all of the available data so you can filter it locally.
Normally, instead of returning all possible entries, you filter in your `Get-` command.

Sometimes, however, you _can't_ filter left.
For example, if you wanted to retrieve all of the services on a computer which were running, how would you do that?

T> #### Getting Help for `Get-Service`
T>
T> Remember, you can use `Get-Help -Name 'Get-Service' -ShowWindow` to display help in a popout.

Notice that there's no parameter for filtering on status.
Instead, you'll have to use the pipeline and the `Where-Object` command.

```powershell
Get-Service | Where-Object -Property Status -eq Running
```

This passes all of the services discovered by `Get-Service` to the filtering command, `Where-Object`.
That command inspects each object, looking to see if its `Status` property is equal to `Running`.
Did it return any results where the services were _not_ running?

Note the use of the `eq` operator.
This is a special [comparison operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_comparison_operators?view=powershell-6) which returns true if the value of the service's `Status` property is equal to `Running`.

## Comparison Operators

It's worth taking some time to discuss the available comparison operators in PowerShell.
You'll use these when building filters and when checking the truthiness of an assumption (is this object equal to that object? does this string match that pattern? etc).
See the table below for the list of operators and what they mean.

| Type        | Operators      | Description |
|:-----------:|:--------------:|-------------|
| Equality    | `eq`          | equals
|             | `ne`          | not equals
|             | `gt`          | greater than
|             | `ge`          | greater than or equal
|             | `lt`          | less than
|             | `le`          | less than or equal
||||
| Matching    | `like`        | Returns true when string matches wildcard pattern
|             | `notlike`     | Returns true when string does not match wildcard pattern
|             | `match`       | Returns true when string matches regex pattern; $matches contains matching strings
|             | `notmatch`    | Returns true when string does not match regex pattern; $matches contains matching strings
||||
| Containment | `contains`    | Returns true when reference value contained in a collection
|             | `notcontains` | Returns true when reference value not contained in a collection
|             | `in`          | Returns true when test value contained in a collection
|             | `notin`       | Returns true when test value not contained in a collection
||||
| Replacement | `replace`     | Replaces a string pattern
||||
| Type        | `is`          | Returns true if both object are the same type
|             | `isnot`       | Returns true if the objects are not the same type

```powershell
# This will evaluate to true:
1 -eq 1
# This will evaluate to false:
1 -eq 2
# This will evaluate to true:
1 -lt 2
# This will return 0, 1:
0, 1, 2 -lt 2
# This will evaluate to true (note the case insensitivity):
"Apple" -like "ap*"
# This will evaluate to false (adding the 'c' denotes case sensitivity):
"Apple" -clike "ap*"
# This will return "apply"
"Apple", "apply" -clike "ap*"
# This will evaluate to true (uses regex, not just wildcard):
"Apple" -match "p{2}"
# This will evaluate to true:
"Apple", "Banana", "Cherry" -contains "apple"
# This will evaluate to true:
"apple" -in "Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"
# This will output "Apply"
"Apple" -replace "e", "y"
# This will output "Acceptable"
"Apple" -replace "p{2}", "cceptab"
# This will output true:
1 -eq "1"
# This will output true:
1 -is [int]
# This will output false:
"1" -is [int]
```

## Exercise 10: Containment Operators

T> Note that you can break longer lines of PowerShell up.
T> If you hit enter _after_ a pipeline operator PowerShell will expect further commands.
T> If you hit enter again without adding more code it **will** error.
T> So you could do something like this:
T>
T> ```powershell
T> # It's not necessary to make everything line
T> # up like this, but it _is_ easier to read.
T> Get-Service |
T>   Where-Object -Property "Something" -eq        -Value "Else" |
T>   Where-Object -Property "Another"   -match     -Value "p{2}" |
T>   Where-Object -Property "Last"      -contains  -Value 1
T> ```

? Use `Get-Service` to retrieve the list of services on your machine and then filter them such that you check whether the value of the `StartType` is **not** in the following list: `"Automatic","Manual"`. Is `RemoteAccess` in the results?

A) Yes
b) No

? Use `Get-Service` to retrieve the list of services on your machine and then filter them such that you only return results where the `ServiceType` property contains `"Win32OwnProcess"`. Is `RemoteAccess` in the results?

a) Yes
B) No

? Pipe the results of the previous question to another filter, this time also filtering out all of the stopped services. How many results do you have now?

! 8

? Filter the results again, this time returning only the services with a display name that matches this pattern: `"^Windows.*Service$"`. How many results do you have now?

! 1

## Where-Object and FilterScript

The solution to the last exercise was complex, requiring the output of each filter to be passed along the pipeline to another filter.

There's a simpler way to do this: use the `FilterScript` parameter of `Where-Object`.
That might look something like this:

```powershell
Get-Service | Where-Object -FilterScript {
  $_.ServiceType -contains "Win32OwnProcess" -and
  $_.Status -ne "Stopped" -and
  $_.DisplayName -match "^Windows.*Service$"
}
```

In the example above you might notice some interesting things we haven't seen before:

* The first is the strange `$_` notation.
  This is the notation in PowerShell to represent the current object in the pipeline.
  `Where-Object` is actually not processing all of the objects from `Get-Service` at the same time.
  Instead, it is checking each object it receives from the pipeline to see if it matches the filter criteria.
  This was true in the earlier examples too.
  * In other words, the `$_` notation is a shortcut to the object currently being processed in the pipeline.
* We're using the `and` operator here.
  Like the comparison operators we've been looking at, `-and` is a special operator that is used in PowerShell, this time for logic.
  Other [logical operators](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_logical_operators?view=powershell-6) include `or`, `xor`, and `not` (see table below).
  * We use the `and` operator to make sure we return only results where _all three_ filter checks are true.
* We placed all of the filters inside of curly braces (`{}`).
  Those denote a _scriptblock_, which is just a chunk of PowerShell code.

| Logical Operator |               Description               |          Example           | Result  |
|:----------------:|:----------------------------------------|:--------------------------:|:-------:|
|       `and`      | TRUE when _both_ statements are TRUE.   | `(1 -eq 1) -and (1 -eq 2)` | `False` |
|       `or`       | TRUE when _either_ statement is TRUE.   | `(1 -eq 1) -or  (1 -eq 2)` | `True`  |
|       `xor`      | TRUE when _only one_ statement is TRUE. | `(1 -eq 1) -xor (2 -eq 2)` | `False` |
|       `not`      | Negates the statement that follows.     | `-not (1 -eq 1)`           | `False` |
|        `!`       | Same as `not`.                          | `!(1 -eq 1)`               | `False` |

You can use the `FilterScript` parameter _instead of_ `Property` and `Value`, the way we've used `Where-Object` up until now.
They are _mutually exclusive_ parameters.
